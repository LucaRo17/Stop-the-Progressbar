## Stop The Progressbar

How I made it, why I made it and where you can see my work.

So I am quite interested in coding. So it was last year when I thought, Why not make a game? And so i did. But I didnt have something in mind. I wanted something simple. Something that children can use. And so Stop the Progressbar began. A simple game that only needed a few clicks and good timing to win.

The only problem? I didnt know C#! But after watching a few introductory video and geting Visual Studio i knew everything I needed to make this game.

Day 1.
The main bits. The form and the buttons. At least that was easy. A few clicks. Winforms C#, .NET 4.8 and Create.

Day 2.
The actual coding. The buttons were generated and coded to do things.

Day 3.
Progressbar. Easy. Right in the middle of the page and set to stop at 100 and give a game over messgae.

Day 4.
Timer. To make the game lose. Now it's hard. I had a few problems with the progressbar stop function but I got it.

Day 5.
It was finally ready. Posted on Github and it was done. Stop the Progressbar. It was amazing (at least to me!). So the further versions came with better things and refined bugs. 

If you download my app I hope you enjoy it. To download select View on GitHub.
